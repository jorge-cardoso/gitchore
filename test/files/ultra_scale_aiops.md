# Description

Description:
- Goal: Develop a PoC which demonstrated the benefits of Edge AI w.r.t. latency, response time and bandwidth
- Background:
  - In recent years, cloud computing has become a central part of the AI evolution. To better address requirements, businesses are becoming aware of the need to bring the technology closer to customers. Thus, Edge AI is emerging as a solution that uses ML to process data generated at the local level. 
- Problem:
  - While the edge model considerably reduces transmission costs and latency requirements, it raises questions with respect to system architectures, AI pipelines and privacy and reliability concerns. 
  - An example of this technology is Amazon Alexa which learns and stores phrases locally using AI.
  - When a user gives a verbal command, the device sends the voice recording to an edge network where it is transformed to text using AI algorithms. 
  - Without an edge network the response time would be seconds, with edge the latency is reduced to <400 ms. 
- Approach:
  - As a starting point, this project will use two use cases involving video recognition, security cameras, OCR, real-time device tracking, as well as cloud gaming and video compression.
  - In one use case, cameras will monitor containers in a transportation chain, while the ML will recompile data in real time for the container tracking process.
  - The two use cases will be used to derive requirements and implement a prototype to demonstrate how edge platforms can be exploited to steer AI-driven applications. 
- Results:
  - The prototype to be developed will serve to experiment with various architecture configurations, derive latency and bandwidth constraints, and explore how high levels of reliability and security can be achieved.
- KPI:
  - Response time < 100ms
